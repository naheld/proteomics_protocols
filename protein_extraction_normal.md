# Protein extraction protocol for proteomics
### For protein samples on polycarbonate filters
### Developed in the Saito lab by Dawn Moran, modified here by Noelle Held

### Materials
* SDS extraction buffer (1% SDS, 0.1M Tris HCL, pH 7.5, 10mM EDTA)
* Ethanol clean 2mL microfuge tubes, 4 per sample
* 50% methanol, 50% acetone, 0.5mM HCL precipitaton solution (ice cold)


### Preparation
* Prepare extraction buffer if needed                                       

### Protocol
* Bring the samples up to lab on ice
* Carefully unfold filter and arrange in a clean 2mL tube to maximize surface area exposed to solvent  
* Add minimal amount (often 1.5mL) SDS extraction buffer to cover and incubate at RT 15mins
* Heat 95C for 10minutes
* Shake RT 350RPM 1hr
* Decant extract into a new 2mL tube and centrifuge high speed for 20mins at room temperature      
* Remove supernatants, carefully leaving the pellet (debris) in the original tube; retain the pellet until samples are run just in case extraction was not successful but you are interested in the supernatant at this time
* If needed, concentrate supernatants in 6mL Vivaspin columns to approximately 300uL (use your judgement about concentration of the sample)
* At this point, perform a preliminary BCA protein concentration assay OR save a small amount to do this later. Add apomyoglobin protein standard at concentration of 100fmol/ug protein if desired at this time.
* Place the sample in a clean 2mL tube and add 50:50 solvent mixture in a 1:4 ratio.
* Leave samples overnight at 20C or longer to precipitate the proteins. 3 days is a good amount of time. START:
* At end of precipitation period, centrifuge the precipitated protein mixture to collect the proteins, usually 30mins at 4C high speed
* Remove supernatant to another clean tube and place back in freezer until samples are run (proteins may continue to precipitate)
* Dry protein pellet by speedvac about 10mins
* Resuspend pellets in minimal SDS buffer at room temperature (shaking may be needed) - about 1hr to totally dissolve
* Quantify the proteins with the BCA protein assay
