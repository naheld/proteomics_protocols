# Soluble gel digestion
### Developed in the Saito Lab and adapted by Noelle Held. 

### Materials
Make everything in LCMS grade H2O, use only LCMS grade reagents
* organic precipitated protein samples
* 100mM Ammonium bicarb (Ambic 100)
* Urea
* DTT

### Prep
* Make fresh 7.5M urea in Ambic 100 (2.25g/5mL)
* make 200mM DTT in ambic 100 (30.9mg/mL)
* make 200mM IODA in ambic 100 (37mg/mL)

### Protocol
* To protein pellets add 100uL urea + 15uL ambic 100 (final concentration is about 6M urea)
* Incubate RT 15min, vortex periodically
* Incubate 5min 95C to fully resuspend
* Take 100uL aliquots and safe remainder
* To aliquots, add 5uL 200mM DTT, incubate 56C 400rPM 1 hr
* Vortex and spin down
* Add 20uL 200mM IODA, incubate 1hr with shaking RT in the dark
* Meanwhile reconstitute 100ug trypsin on ice in 0.5mL 50mM acetic acid for 30min with periodic mixing
* Add trypsin in 1:50 ratio with the amount of protein in the aliquot as determined by BCA assay
* Incubate 37C overnight with shaking
* vortex, spin down samples and collect the top. A pellet may occur
* Speed vac to desired concentration (typically 1ug/uL)
* Acidify to pH 4 with acetic acid
* If urea precipitation is a problem, zip tip the sample
* Dilute in buffer B if needed to desired concentration
