# Protein extraction protocol for phosphoproteomics
### For protein samples on polycarbonate filters
### Developed in the Saito lab by Dawn Moran, modified for phosphoproteomics by Noelle Held

### Materials
* SDS extraction buffer (1% SDS, 0.1M Tris HCL, pH 7.5, 10mM EDTA)
* Ethanol clean 2mL microfuge tubes, 4 per sample
* 50/50 Methanol: Acetone solvent mixture (cold)
* 500mM sodium pyrophosphate
* 500mM sodium fluoride
* 500mM sodium orthovanadate (needs to be activated - see White lab protocols)

### Preparation
* Prepare extraction buffer with phosphatase inhibitors by adding 0.1mL of each inhibitor solution per mL of SDS extraction buffer, for a final concentration of 5mM of each inhibitor                                        

### Protocol
* Perform all steps on ice unless otherwise noted
* Carefully unfold filter and arrange in a clean 2mL tube to maximize surface area exposed to solvent  
* Add 1.5mL SDS extraction buffer with phosphatase inhibitors and incubate at RT 15mins
* Shake 350rpm for 1h (note that we are avoiding the heat step to preserve the protein phosphorylation)
* Decant extract into a new 2mL tube and centrifuge high speed for 20mins at room temperature      
* Remove supernatants, carefully leaving the pellet (debris) in the original tube; retain the pellet until samples are run just in case extraction was not successful
* Concentrate supernatants in 6mL Vivaspin columns to approximately 300uL (use your judgement about concentration of the sample)
* Place the sample in a clean 2mL tube and add 50:50 solvent mixture in a 1:4 ratio.
* Leave samples overnight at 20C or longer to precipitate the proteins. START:
* At end of precipitation period, centrifuge the precipitated protein mixture to collect the proteins, 30mins at 4C high speed
* Remove supernatant to another clean tube and place back in freezer until samples are run (proteins may continue to precipitate)
* Dry proteins by speedvac about 10mins
* Resuspend pellets in minimal SDS buffer at room temperature (shaking may be needed) - about 1hr to totally dissolve
* Quantify the proteins with the Bio-RAD DC protein assay
